# Image-Super-Resolution-Model

Machine learning project on an image denoising/super-resolution app, by Dimitri Christopoulos, Evan Cureton, and Arnauld Binder.

Format of project:
1. ./dataset:
    - Contains dataset.py, used for to lower the resolution of images and image preprocessing.
    - Contains utils.py, a helper function used to obtain image paths from desktop.

2. ./model:
    - Contains super_resolution.py which is the autoencoder model

3. ./weights:
    - Contains trained weights

4. test.py
    - Python program used for testing

5. train.py
    - Python program used for training
